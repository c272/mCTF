# mCTF
*An emulator for the "Medea" CTF specification, for RACTF 2020.*

This is a simple emulator for an instruction set specification from Really Awesome CTF 2020, called "Medea". The VM has support for running both compressed and uncompressed Medea images, and fully implements all instructions (no stubs!)

The whole thing was built in the span of 1.5 days, so the code is quite messy. I've cleaned it up post-CTF, but there are probably still bugs. Feel free to PR if you really want something fixed.
